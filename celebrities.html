<p> Kim Kardashian, Cardi B, Kylie Jenner, and Jennifer Lopez are just three of the many celebrities 
    who are often showing off one of their fashionable Hermès Birkin bags.From brightly colored choices 
    to darker toned classics, you can tell their choices from the epic collections, which can range 
    from $11,000 to $200,000 in price, are carefully considered and seem to perfectly match either 
    their outfits and/or manicured nails whenever they need them to.

<p>While many celebs own a Hermès bag or two, very few of them can compete with Victoria Beckham’s Hermès 
    collection. The ex Spice Girl has one of the largest Hermès bag collections in the world with over 
    100 bags by the brand. In fact, her collection is so valuable, that she has over $2 million dollars 
    worth of Hermès bags in her wardrobe. With bags made from exotic crocodile skins and luxurious 
    ostrich, she definitely doesn’t settle for the basic bags. Victoria Beckham has been spotted on 
    numerous occasions carrying bags well worth over $50,000 each.
