<p>The Birkin Bag, created by Hermès is a roomy, elegant-yet-sporty bag with handles designed to 
    be carried in the hand or on the wrist, with four studs on the base, the Birkin represented a new, 
    modern statement from a fashion house known for its traditional, classical stance. Up until that 
    point, the Kelly bag – ladylike, stiff and boxy by comparison – epitomised Hermès’ world.

<p>Hermès Birkin bags are some of the most expensive bags in the world, ranging anywhere from 
    $9,000 to half a million dollars. The bags embody absolute luxury. Thirty years on from its launch, 
    demand is such that there is no longer a waiting list for the bag, in the classic sense of the term. 
    “It’s a wish list, not an order list. They don’t take orders any more; you just have to hope,” says 
    Jérôme Lalande, an antique dealer specialising in 20th-Century leather goods.
