<p>In 2012, Hermès unveiled a stunning collection of handbag-inspired jewelry from the Haute Bijouterie 
    Collection. This collection was designed by Pierre Hardy, the creative director of fine jewelry at 
    Hermès. One of the most stunning pieces from the collection was the Sac Bijou Birkin, priced around 
    $2 million USD. This Hermès bag is crafted from rose gold inlaid with 2,712 diamonds. The miniaturized
     Birkin is fully functional and intended to be worn as a bracelet.

<p>The Himalaya Birkin comes both with and without diamonds. The Diamond Himalaya is infamous for being 
    the most expensive handbag ever sold at auction. In 2017, the Diamond Himalaya Birkin sold for over 
    $400,000 USD. The Birkin’s estimated retail price was $300,000 USD, but the rarity of the Hermès bag 
    drove the price point up at auction. It is constructed out of Niloticus crocodile skin dyed in a 
    white and grey gradient. The unique coloring of the Hermès bag is intended to evoke the white-capped 
    peaks of the Himalaya Mountains. This coloring pairs perfectly with 18-karat white gold hardware, 
    which is itself studded with white diamonds.

<p>The glamorous Diamond Birkin bag is a favorite of Hermès fanatics. It is the sister of the 
    Himalaya Diamond Birkin, differing only in the treatment of the exotic skin. A true collectors 
    item, this Hermès handbag features crocodile skin paired with diamond-encrusted white gold hardware.
    These rare Birkin bags’ estimated cost range from $190,000 USD to $260,000 USD depending on color 
    and size.
